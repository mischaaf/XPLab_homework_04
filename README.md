# XPLab_homework_04-05

This repository contains the fourth homework of the experimental psychology lab. It is handed in by Cora Burgwinkel and Mirijam Schaaf.
We created the mental rotation task by starting from the babe departure point. For homework 05 we finished the in-class exercises. The mental rotation task is now completely implemented.
